        CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a language used to style the appearance of content written in HTML. It controls the layout, colors, fonts, spacing, and overall look of web pages. By separating structure (HTML) from design (CSS), it makes websites easier to manage and allows for a consistent style across multiple pages.
